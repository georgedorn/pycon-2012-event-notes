many benefits of classes are nebulous.  e.g. "decoupling"
yagni
if your class has two methods and one is __init__, it's not a class
namespaces are not for taxonomies, they're for preventing collisions
LookupError is a great stdlib exception, use it
stdlib exceptions might be sufficient
FooException is redundant
Good classes:
    containers (but see heapq)
    if a big colllection of functions all take the same parameter, maybe a class makes sense (e.g.heapq)

bad classes:
    python-oauth2, rewritten as python-foauth2
    google api python client
