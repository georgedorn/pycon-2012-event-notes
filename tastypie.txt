Use good HTTP codes.
Graceful degredation to older versions of the API.
Flexible serialization (support whatever the client wants; xml, plists, yaml)

Data can round-trip.  Whatever you GET, you should be able to PUSH back the exact same format.
HATEOAS - no documentation required
	entire API should be discoverable
