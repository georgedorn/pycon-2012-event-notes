-e.g.

track = track_from_file(mp3_file_object)
track.key #key of music
track.key_confidence #how confidence it is
track.tempo #bpm
track.tempo_confidence

track.sections:
	list of dicts about autodetected section changes
track.bars:
	tries to determine the bars
track.tatum:
	signature?
track.segments:
	very small, every note-ish
	also contains loudness points and levels
	also contains pitch data of the segment, can be used to deduce chords
	also contains timbre?  magic numbers describe what kind of instrument this is

uses:
- Matt Ogle's tool to analyze your last.fm song keys
- Evidence of the loudness war
- determine if drummer's using a click track
- splice songs (bicklenack)
- morecowbell
- swinger, deswinger

Other libraries:
- marsyas, vamp, aubio

Qs:
- Embedded code is holovaty's own flash code
- percussion detection is good.  maybe timbre can determine drum hit type?
- other scales like pentatonic?  no clue, but probably.
